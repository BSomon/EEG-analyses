# EEG-analyses
This repository contains several scripts that I made using EEGLAB functions (see https://github.com/sccn/eeglab), in order to analyze EEG data in a very straightforward manner and without the GUI. 

Notably the Analysis.m script allows to:
 - analyze ERPs, spectral data, ERSPs and ITCs
 - perform a statistical permutation analysis
 - report the p and F values
 - export all data in one ".mat" file
 
Prerequisits are a loaded study in EEGLAB (2019.x) and pre-computed ERPs, time-frequency and frequency data.
